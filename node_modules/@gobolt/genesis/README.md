# GENESIS Design System

[Storybook hosted on Google Cloud](https://genesis-storybook-365607811897.us-central1.run.app/?path=/docs/genesis-design-system-design-tokens-color-tokens--docs)

The GENESIS design system standardizes our colors, fonts, and sizing tokens across all our apps. 

It unifies frontend app development around these core libraries:

- [Antd](https://ant.design/) v5
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) v5
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) v5
- [React](https://react.dev/) v18


## ðŸ“¦ Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To scaffold a new component, run `npm run generate` and add the component name in PascalCase 

example:
```
npm run generate RadioGroup
```


## ðŸ”¨ Usage

Install the GENESIS library

```
npm install @gobolt/genesis
```

The `GenesisProvider` must included within the application as it supplies the Genesis Theme. 

```jsx
import { Button, GenesisProvider } from '@gobolt/genesis;

const Demo = () = {

    const onClick = (value) => {
        console.log("Genesis button clicked with value: ", value);
    }

    return (
        <GenesisProvider>
            <Button onClick={onClick}>Ship</Button>
        </GenesisProvider>
    )
 };
```

The library exports both the components and their types which are documented in our storybook.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```
npm test 
```

[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) has been configured to automatically run the tests on push to Github and will enforce that all tests pass.  

## ðŸš€ Publishing 

This project uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to create the package and [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage it's versions. We only need to run changesets when we're ready to release and publish the library.

```
npx changeset
npx changeset version
npm publish
```

## ðŸ“™ Storybook Deployment to Google Cloud

```
just deploy
```

See the .justfile which simplifies this [Storybook GCP script on Notion](https://www.notion.so/gobolt/Deploy-Genesis-Storybook-to-GCP-1759f4303960806e8d88cf1e751cb19d).
